    <p>Kybertrike is a spiritual successor to the 90's PC game CyberStrike2, inspired by tactical battles with lasers,
        explosives, and energy management.</p>

    <p>This is a nostalgic revival of my favorite classic, aiming to capture its unique blend of strategy and fast-paced
        combat.</p>

    <p>Stay tuned as I work towards the 1.0 release in October 2025. I'll be sharing monthly updates on Patreon with
        insights into game mechanics, character lore, and progress on the journey!</p>
